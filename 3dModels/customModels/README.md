# Custom Models for SCARA Manipulator Project

This folder contains custom 3D models designed to enhance the SCARA manipulator project. Each model addresses specific limitations of the original design and provides additional functionality. Below is a brief overview of each model:

### 1. xyPlaneMicroswitchBarrier.stl
**Purpose:** Provides an obstacle for the XY-Plane microswitch.  
**Description:** This component is designed to improve the homing support of the manipulator by creating a barrier that the microswitch can detect, ensuring accurate positioning.

### 2. zAxisMicroswitchSupport.stl
**Purpose:** Attaches the Z-Axis microswitch to a support rod.  
**Description:** This support structure allows the Z-Axis microswitch to be securely mounted, enabling precise control and homing for the Z-axis.

### 3. hardwareBox.stl
**Purpose:** Houses the microcontroller, CNC shield, drivers, and their connections.  
**Description:** This enclosure is designed with ventilation openings and cable exits to accommodate the electronic hardware, ensuring proper cooling and easy access for connections.

### 4. boxPlatform.stl
**Purpose:** Secures the hardware box at the back of the manipulator.  
**Description:** This support platform is designed to mount the hardware box onto the manipulator's structure, providing stability and proper positioning for the electronics.
