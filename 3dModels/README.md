# 3D Models

This directory contains all 3D models used in the development of the SCARA manipulator. The models are organized into three categories:

## Custom Models
These models were specifically designed for this project. They are original designs tailored to meet the projectâ€™s requirements.

- **customModels/**: Contains all original 3D designs created for the SCARA manipulator.


## External Models
Some models used in this project were sourced from external creators. Each model is stored in a separate folder.

- **externalModels/**: Contains 3D models that were sourced from external creators. Each subfolder includes the model file(s).

- ***Scara robotic arm***: [Scara robotic arm for educational purposes.] - [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1241491].
- ***AS5600 NEMA 17 bracket***: [AS5600 3D-printable bracket for NEMA17 stepper motor.] - [https://curiousscientist.tech/blog/as5600-magnetic-position-encoder].


## Modified Models
Some external models have been modified to fit the needs of this project. These modifications are documented, and the modified models are stored in this directory.

- **modifiedModels/**: Contains modified versions of external 3D models. Each file is accompanied by a description of the modifications made.


### Attribution and Licensing
We respect the original creators of the external models and have included all necessary attributions and licenses as provided by the authors. If you are one of the original creators and would like additional credit or have any concerns, please contact us.
